# Quasar App (code)
A Quasar Framework app using Firebase.  Allows a user to add themselves to a queue that an admin can monitor to find who is 'next in line' without the person being present.

Project will not run without the following updated:
quasar.conf -> devServer updated with ADDRESS:PORT
firebase API info -> apiKey, authDomain, projectId, storageBucket,
  messagingSenderId, appId

```

### Lint the files

npm run lint
```

### Build the app for production
